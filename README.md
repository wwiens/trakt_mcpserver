A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that creates a bridge between AI language models and the Trakt.tv API, allowing LLMs to access real-time entertainment data and personal Trakt viewing history.

## üñ•Ô∏è An AI Experiment
Other than this paragraph, everything here has been generated by AI, including
the code. I had a goal to learn more about MCP and have been playing a lot with
Cursor, so it seemed like a natural next move to bring these together. The result
was this project. All changes moving forward will also be done by AI.

## ü§ñ What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open specification that enables Large Language Models (LLMs) like Claude to interact with external systems and data sources. 

MCP creates a standardized way for AI models to:

- Access real-time data beyond their training cutoff date
- Connect to external APIs and web services through dedicated servers
- Execute specialized tools and functions securely
- Read from and write to external resources
- Process complex data that would be difficult to handle in text-only formats

At its core, MCP works by defining:

1. **Resources**: Structured data sources that an AI can read from or write to (like `trakt://shows/trending`)
2. **Tools**: Functions that the AI can invoke to perform specific actions (like `fetch_trending_shows`)
3. **Sessions**: Secure connections between the AI and MCP servers

MCP servers like this one act as bridges between AI models and the external world, allowing them to be extended with new capabilities without requiring retraining.

## üì∫ What is Trakt?

[Trakt.tv](https://trakt.tv) is a platform that automatically tracks what TV shows and movies you watch. The service offers:

- Comprehensive tracking of viewing habits across multiple streaming services
- Social features to share and discuss what you're watching with friends
- Personalized recommendations based on your viewing history
- Extensive APIs that developers can use to build applications

Trakt has become the standard for entertainment tracking with:
- Over 14 million users tracking their viewing habits
- Data on millions of movies and TV shows, including detailed metadata
- Integration with popular media players and streaming services

This MCP server taps into Trakt's rich API ecosystem to bring real-time entertainment data directly to your conversations with AI assistants like Claude.

## üöÄ The Cursor Development Experience

This entire project was developed using [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/), a code editor built for the AI era, with Claude 3.7 Sonnet generating all code. This approach demonstrates:

- How AI-assisted development can dramatically accelerate building specialized MCP servers
- The capabilities of modern AI in writing functional, well-structured code
- A collaborative workflow between human intent and AI implementation

## üîê Authentication

The server uses Trakt's device authentication flow:

1. When you request user-specific data, the server will automatically initiate authentication if needed
2. You'll receive a code and a URL to visit on your browser
3. After entering the code on the Trakt website and authorizing the app, inform Claude that you've completed the authorization
4. Claude will check the authentication status and then fetch your personal data
5. Your authentication token is stored securely for future requests

You can log out at any time using the `clear_auth` tool.

## üöÄ Setup

1. **Clone this repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mcp-trakt.git
   cd mcp-trakt
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up your environment**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Then edit `.env` to add your Trakt API credentials:
   ```
   TRAKT_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
   TRAKT_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
   ```

4. **Run the server**
   ```bash
   python server.py
   ```

- "Can you recommend some popular movies this week?"
- "What are the most watched shows of the month?"
- "Show me the shows I've watched" (requires authentication)
- "What was the last show I watched?" (requires authentication)
- "Show me the movies I've watched" (requires authentication)
- "What was the last movie I watched?" (requires authentication)
- "Search for shows like 'Breaking Bad'"
- "Check me in to Season 2 Episode 5 of Breaking Bad" (uses title)
- "Check me in to Season 1 Episode 3 of show ID 1388 and share it on Twitter" (uses ID)
- "Show me comments for Breaking Bad"
- "What are people saying about The Godfather movie?"
- "Show me comments for Season 1 of Stranger Things"
- "Get comments for Season 2 Episode 5 of Game of Thrones"
- "Show me comment #12345 with its replies"
- "Show me comments for Breaking Bad but include spoilers"
- "Search for movies like 'The Godfather'"
- "Show me the most liked comments for Breaking Bad" (uses sort="likes")
- "Get the highest rated comments for The Godfather movie" (uses sort="highest")
- "Show me the comments with most replies for Season 1 of Stranger Things" (uses sort="replies")
- "What's the rating for Game of Thrones?"
- "Show me the rating distribution for The Godfather"
- "How highly rated is Breaking Bad?"

Claude will use this MCP server to provide you with real-time data from Trakt.

## üë§ Personal Data Access

With authentication, you can access:

- Your complete watched show and movie history
- Last watched dates for each show and movie
- Number of times you've watched each show and movie
- Check in to shows you're currently watching and track your progress
- Personal viewing statistics
- Share your viewing activity on social media platforms

All data is fetched directly from your Trakt account in real-time.

## üîÆ Future Development

- Extending user authentication to access more personal data
- Adding calendar events for upcoming episodes
- Supporting scrobbling (tracking what you're watching)
- Implementing recommendations based on watch history
- Adding support for more social media platforms for sharing
